## Monitoring
### Prometheus 
- [Prometheus vs OpenTelemetry](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-vs-prometheus/)
- Prometheus deals exclusively with time-series metrics.
- Prometheus is a self-contained system with its own storage and query language (PromQL).

### Opentelemetry 
- [Prometheus vs OpenTelemetry](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-vs-prometheus/)
- OpenTelemetry supports metrics, distributed traces, and logs.
- jest bardziej kompleksowy od Prometheusa, potrafi to samo + wspiera metrics, traces, and logs.
- OpenTelemetry uses a vendor-neutral, pluggable design allowing integration with various backends.

### Jaeger - tracing
- [Jaeger - docsy](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/2.2/)
- Jaeger, inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing platform created by Uber Technologies and donated to Cloud Native Computing Foundation. 
- It can be used for monitoring microservices-based distributed systems:
- With Jaeger you can: 
    - Monitor and troubleshoot distributed workflows
    - Identify performance bottlenecks
    - Track down root causes
    - Analyze service dependencies

### Zipkin - tracing
- [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)
Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. Features include both the collection and lookup of this data.

### Datadog 
- [Datadog - stronka](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
- Paid monitoring system!

### Grafana
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/)
- Grafana is a visualization tool.

### Loki

## CI/CD
### Which CNCF project for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) comes with both a CLI and Web UI?
### Argo
- [Argo CD vs Flux](https://rajputvaibhav.medium.com/argo-cd-vs-flux-cd-right-gitops-tool-for-your-kubernetes-cluster-c71cff489d26)
Argo comes with a powerful UI that helps visualize relations between different objects and monitor them better while with Flux you rely completely on CLI. You can add on the web UI to Flux but it still stays experimental.

### Jenkins X
- [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/)
Jenkins X is opinionated and built to work better with technologies like Docker or Kubernetes. It is not a CNCF project.

### Flux

# Kubernetes packaging?
## two ways to package, deploy, and manage a Kubernetes application?
- Kubernetes operators and Helm charts are tools that stir up confusion in the industry -- they seem to fill the same role, but they do slightly different things.
- [When to use Kubernetes operators vs. Helm charts](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/tip/When-to-use-Kubernetes-operators-vs-Helm-charts)

### Helm Charts  
- [HelmCharts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/)
- [When to use Kubernetes operators vs. Helm charts](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/tip/When-to-use-Kubernetes-operators-vs-Helm-charts)
- Helm is a packaging format that works well with simple applications like stateless microservices and REST-based APIs with states stored externally in the cloud.
  
Helm is a package manager designed specifically for Kubernetes and improves the management of the YAML manifests required to create Kubernetes projects. At the heart of Helm is the packaging format called charts. Each chart comprises one or more Kubernetes manifests -- and a given chart can have child charts and dependent charts, as well.
  
Thus, Helm can tackle the complexities of dependency management for a Kubernetes project. Rather than an IT admin simply listing the files to install via kubectl, a single command can install an entire application, and Helm will pull the required dependencies and apply the manifests.
  
Helm also retains a release history of all deployed charts, so IT teams can go back to a previous release if something goes wrong.

### Kubernetes operators
- [When to use Kubernetes operators vs. Helm charts](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/tip/When-to-use-Kubernetes-operators-vs-Helm-charts)
- However, as time progresses and developer teams unlock the full potential of the platform, the application becomes complex and grows in tandem with its additional requirements -- like statefulness -- and requires more complex logic. This complexity creates challenges for authoring those Helm charts-templatized YAML manifests; at this point, it is time to adopt the powerful operator pattern supported in Kubernetes.
   
Operators are geared toward site reliability engineering teams to manage the complex runbooks that orchestrate the deployment of a complex application, along with automating mundane tasks for the Kubernetes platform.
  
Kubernetes operators build on custom resources and controllers. In plain terms, an IT admin can define their resources in Kubernetes and publish logic -- via an operator -- that can handle CRUD operations for the custom resource. These custom resources can model a complex application or a standard templatized application; the operators maintain the resource's lifecycle.
