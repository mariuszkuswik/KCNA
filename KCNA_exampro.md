Kubernetes utilizes a "hub-and-spoke" API pattern. Which Kubernetes component is responsible as the hub for communication?
- API Server
- Kuberenetes Hub
- Kubectl
- Control Plane
- Kubelet

Question: Which statement about Ingress is correct? Possible answers:
A. Ingress provides a simple way to track network endpoints within a cluster.
B. Ingress is a Service type like NodePort and ClusterIP.
C. Ingress is a construct that allows you to specify how a Pod is allowed to communicate.
D. Ingress exposes routes from outside the cluster to services in the cluster.

Poprawne D


This is correct because:
Ingress is defined as an API object that manages external access to services within a Kubernetes cluster.
It acts as a single entry point for incoming traffic, routing it to the appropriate services based on the routing rules set by the developer.
Ingress provides routing rules to manage access to the services within a Kubernetes cluster, typically using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
It allows you to expose multiple services under the same IP address, providing features like SSL termination, load balancing, and name-based virtual hosting.
The other options are incorrect:
A. This is not the primary function of Ingress.
B. Ingress is not a Service type, but rather a separate API object26.
C. This description is more applicable to NetworkPolicies, not Ingress.
